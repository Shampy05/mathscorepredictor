## End to End Machine Learning Project 

### 1. Look at the big picture
#### 1.1 Frame the problem
- **Goal**: Build a model of predicting the math score of students based on the given data.
- **Type of problem**: Supervised learning, regression task
- **Performance measure**: R^2 (Coefficient of Determination)

#### 1.2 Select a performance measure
- **R^2 (Coefficient of Determination)**: The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It is a statistic used in the context of statistical models whose main purpose is either the prediction of future outcomes or the testing of hypotheses, on the basis of other related information. It provides a measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, based on the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of the absolute differences between predictions and actual values. It gives an idea of how wrong the predictions were.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of the squared differences between predictions and actual values. Squaring the errors removes the negative sign, and it also amplifies larger differences. It is more popular than MAE, because MSE "punishes" larger errors, which tends to be useful in the real world.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the mean squared error. It is even more popular than MSE, because RMSE is interpretable in the "y" units.
